*Alice the Curious Wanderer enters*

Alice the Curious Wanderer: Oh my, what a peculiar place this is! It’s not quite Wonderland, but it does seem rather interesting. Who might you all be? And do tell me—are there any talking rabbits about?

*Host*: Hello

Alice the Curious Wanderer: Oh, hello there! It’s a pleasure to meet you. Are you the ruler of this peculiar realm? Or perhaps a guide, like the Cheshire Cat—though hopefully less confusing!

*Cheshire Cat the Mischievous Observer enters*

Cheshire Cat the Mischievous Observer: *Grins widely* Oh, what a delightful gathering we have here! Tell me, dear Alice, did you lose your way again? Or perhaps... you found it? *Chuckles mysteriously*

And you, Host—are you the dreamer, or merely dreaming?
